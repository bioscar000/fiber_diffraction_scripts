# Fiber Diffraction Analysis Pipeline

## Description

This repository contains a Python-based pipeline developed for the analysis of fiber diffraction data in the context of a PhD thesis.

The code performs a complete workflow including:
- Averaging of diffraction images
- Buffer subtraction
- 1D azimuthal integration (equatorial and meridional)
- Extraction of structural parameters
- Peak detection and refinement

The implementation is tailored to specific experimental datasets and beamtime configurations.

## Usage

Edit the input data path in `main.py`:

```python
root_path = Path("path_to_data")
```

Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Results will be saved in:

```
outputs/
```

## Output

The pipeline generates:

- Diffractograms (`.tif`)  
- 1D profiles (`.dat`)  
- Structural parameters (`structural_parameters.csv`)  

---

## Important Notes

- This code was developed for a **specific experimental setup and dataset**.  
- Several parameters (e.g., beamtime-dependent corrections and fitting ranges) are **not generalizable**.  
- Users working with different data will likely need to adapt:
  - Angular ranges in integration  
  - Peak detection parameters  
  - Model fitting constraints  

---

## Reproducibility

This repository contains the **frozen version of the code used in the PhD thesis**.  

No further development or maintenance is intended.
